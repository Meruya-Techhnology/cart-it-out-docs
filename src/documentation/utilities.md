# Utilities
During building Cart it out, we feel that every programmers need is all in one package. Then we decided to add some Utilities, alongside the main feature of the Cart it out.

## Debouncer
Need throtling ? you can use `Debouncer` 
```dart
/// First import
import 'package:cart_it_out/common/utils/debouncer.dart';

/// Then init
final _debouncer = Debouncer(
    duration: const Duration(
        seconds: 1,
    ),
);

/// Then use it on your method
Future<void> onQueryChange(String? value) async {
    _debouncer.run(_searchProduct);
}
```

## FocusNode Disabler
Didn't need any focus node ? try `AlwaysDisabledFocusNode`, this class will prevent any TextField to focus. This will be very helpful if you are building non-focus able TextField UI. Here is the example
```dart
TextFormField(
    readOnly: true,
    focusNode: AlwaysDisabledFocusNode(),
);
```

## BuildProfile
Sometimes we need a build profile to decide certain things like base path URL (development, staging, production), using `kDebugMode` or `kProfileMode` or `kReleaseMode` sometimes, is not enought. Maybe you want another name like `development, staging, and production` For utilizing the configuration, you can set launch.json inside the `.vscode` directory. Then add this map to `configurations` array like this
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "cart-it-out [Development]",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart", 
            "flutterMode": "debug",
            "args": [
                "--dart-define",
                "PROFILE=development",
            ],
        },
    ]
}
```
Notice not only using `"flutterMode": "debug"` which you can retrieve with `kDebugMode` you can also use `BuildProfile.getCurrent` to get current build profile from configured dart define arguments `--dart-define PROFILE=development`. The object returned from this method is `CurrentBuildProfile` enum
```dart
var buildProfile = BuildProfile.getCurrent;
```

## RouteUtil
Route util is utillity class for route and navigation management, you can put your initial route, page routes, on generate routes and navigator key. 
1. Navigator Key, we need navigator key for retrieving current locale and for using the internalization function. Navigator key is used in the `MaterialApp` then it's being acessed from `TranslationExtension` to fetch currentContext
2. Initial routes, on the initial routes variable you can set static String or add a middleware logic inside the method. For example you can set wether to allow user to go to homepage after login / before login
3. Routes, routes is a map for every page on this application. You can add, remove, and update the routes depend on your needs. Each page must be registered on this route because later we can navigate the user using `namedRoutes` which is very dynamic and easy to use, later you can add deeplink to it too !
4. OnGenerateroutes, this method will called every new route generated by the MaterialApp, this will called on push / pop. As a default we put some fullscreen dialog function inside the OnGenerateRoute to fetch the passed arguments because by default the arguments must be passed by a constructor which is doesn't uniform the rest of the page file standard. 


`RouteUtil` is used in `GlobalProvider` it's called like this
```dart
class GlobalProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
    final BuildContext context;

    GlobalProvider({
        required this.context,
    });

    ...
    RouteUtil get routeUtil => RouteUtil(context: context);
    GlobalKey<NavigatorState> get navigatorKey => RouteUtil.navigatorKey;
    ...
}
```
On the main class it's accessed like this
```dart
class FlutterApp extends ChangeNotifierPage<GlobalProvider> {
  @override
  Widget buildWidget(
    BuildContext context,
    Widget? child,
    Object? arguments,
  ) {
    return Consumer<GlobalProvider>(
      builder: (context, provider, child) => MaterialApp(
        title: 'Cart It Out',
        themeMode: provider.themeMode,
        theme: provider.themeUtil.lightTheme,
        darkTheme: provider.themeUtil.darkTheme,
        routes: provider.routeUtil.routes,
        initialRoute: provider.routeUtil.initialRoute,
        onGenerateRoute: provider.routeUtil.onGenerateRoute,
        locale: provider.currentLocale,
        supportedLocales: provider.supportedLocales,
        localizationsDelegates: provider.localizationsDelegates,
        navigatorKey: provider.navigatorKey,
        navigatorObservers: [
          RouteObserver<PageRoute>(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  GlobalProvider create(BuildContext context, Object? arguments) {
    return GlobalProvider(
      context: context,
    );
  }
}
```
